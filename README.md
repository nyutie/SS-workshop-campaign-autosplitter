# SS-workshop-campaign-autosplitter by nyutie

## Features:

- auto splits

- auto reset

- use game time

## What's it for:

Any workshop campaign. Works with bonus campaigns too.

## How to use:
There's a checkbox in the autosplitter settings for whether to split on stage change. This is for if you wanna do subsplits for levels within the campaign.

To create splits for a campaign, create many empty splits, beat the campaign and delete the leftover splits. You can then name the splits whatever you want.

## Works with:

Currently only works only with steam patch 5.1 and 5.2. Works with any dx version.

Epic and older steam patches support coming soon... maybe.

If you'd be willing to let me borrow your gog account for adding gog support, please let me know in the official [Greylock Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tBEvADR3tS), or the official [SS/EPN Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/QaJJ9WBxGA).
